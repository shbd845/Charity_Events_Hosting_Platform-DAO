<h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>In today's time ,charity events have become a major player in helping people with black money launder their dirty cash.
This leads to low public engagement and participation in charitable events. 
The Problem is that these traditional charity organizations face issues with transparency, accountability and trust because these organizations often have a centralized decision-making structure which can lead to inefficiencies and a lack of community involvement.

<h2>SOLUTION</h2> We propose a decentralised Autonomous Organization(DAO) as a solution to our problem.
The main problem here is that a centralized authority manages everything without any transparency and community involvement.BLOCKCHAIN provides the best solution for this because the problem we are trying to address here,are the main virtues of blockchain technology like:Decentralization,Transparency,Traceability,Immutability etc.
<h2>AIM</h2>The aim of this project is to create a decentralized and transparent way of organizing and managing charity events that would allow for a more democratic and efficient way of organizing events by allowing members to propose and vote on ideas, and to manage funds.
